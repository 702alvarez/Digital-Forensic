# Digital Forensics Projects

This repository showcases hands‑on digital forensics work: evidence acquisition, analysis, reporting, and policy validation. It includes two projects—**Task 1: Forensic Evidence Analysis** and **Task 2: Autopsy Investigation**—with real screenshots from my workflow.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 🔹 Task 1 – Forensic Evidence Analysis
**Goal:** Maximize evidence collection while minimizing organizational impact; preserve chain of custody; analyze artifacts to confirm (or refute) policy violations.

**Highlights:**
- Evidence collection plan with system isolation and chain‑of‑custody discipline.
- Acquisition via **FTK Imager**; volatile capture via **Belkasoft**.
- Examination using **Paraben E3** and recovery of deleted items; keyword/string searches.
- Reporting aligned to *Best Practices for Seizing Electronic Evidence v3*.

### 🔹 Task 2 – Forensic Investigation (Autopsy Case Study)
**Goal:** Build a full case in **Autopsy** (case creation, ingest, triage of carved/unallocated space, and extraction) and assess potential AUP/NDA violations.

**Workflow Summary:**
1. Created **J.Smith** case; assigned examiner and case number; added image: `Jsmith_Q1.001`.
2. Triaged **deleted files**, **carved/unallocated**, and **metadata artifacts**.
3. Extracted items of interest for reporting; identified confidential/proprietary documents and deletion activity.
4. Assessed violations (AUP/NDA) supported by artifacts.
